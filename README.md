# Lorenz-system-time-series

Contains python scripts to generate and plot data of Lorenz system used in Manuscript "Dirac comb and exponential frequency spectra in nonlinear dynamics" (arXiv:2106.15904).

# Requirements
 - `numpy`
 - `scipy`
 - `matplotlib`
 - `uit_scripts` (optional, specifies plotting parameters) 

 # Use

Time series are generated by running

```console
python create_time_series.py 
```

Plots are created by 
```console
python create_time_series.py 
```
Set `fit=False` for Figure 1 and  `fit=False` for Figure 5 in the main function of `create_time_series.py `.
