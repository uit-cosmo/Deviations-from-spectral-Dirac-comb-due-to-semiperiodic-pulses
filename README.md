Python scripts to generate and plot data used in Manuscript "Dirac comb and exponential frequency spectra in nonlinear dynamics" (arXiv:2106.15904).


 ### Genreate data and figures

Lorentz system time series are generated by running:

```console
python create_lorentz_time_series.py 
```

Plots are created by:
```console
python plot_lorentz_time_series.py       # Figure 1
python create_figure_2.py                # Figure 2
python create_figure_3.py                # Figure 3
python create_figure_4.py                # Figure 4
python create_figure_5.py                # Figure 5
python plot_lorentz_time_series.py --fit # Figure 6
python create_figure_7_8.py              # Figure 7, 8
```
### Requirements
 - `numpy = 1.21.2`
 - `scipy = 1.7.3`
 - `matplotlib = 3.5.0`
 - `click = 8.0.3`
 - `superposed-pulses = 1.2`
 - `cosmoplots = 0.1.5`
 - `closedexpressions = 0.1.1`

Compatibility with other package version is not tested.
